## Using the installation scripts

To use the installation scripts, simply run this command as root. The script will ask you whether you would like to install just the panel, just the daemon or both.

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UTrosh/pterodactyl-installer/master/install.sh)
```

_Note: On some systems, it's required to be already logged in as root before executing the one-line command (where `sudo` is in front of the command does not work)._
